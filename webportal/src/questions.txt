How many harrasment cases have you tried from the defendant side?

Would you try to get the charges thrown out at Prelim Hearing:
    Arguing that no crime was commited.

Wha are your experiences with judge lang

Would you be able to make a call and get Evan out of the fingerprinting?

Why did you decide to leave the DA's office.
